# Challenges for GRCon24 (GNU Radio Conference 2024)

## Overview

All of our challenges are independent, but there is a xxxxx to the flavortext that ties them all together. This year we assigned our puzzles points in the range of (23, 199) based on difficulty.

## Layout

Each challenge has a `public/` folder that holds files facing the challenger, and a `private/` folder with solutions and creation files for the challenge. Please ignore any challenge with a `xxx_` prefix.

## Order of Challenges

All challenges should be released sequentially over the _first_ day at GRCon.
