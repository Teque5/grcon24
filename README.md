# Challenges for GRCon24

GNU Radio Conference 2024 in XXXXXXX(location) on XXXX-XX-XX

## Overview

All of our challenges are independent, but there is a xxxxx to the flavortext that ties them all together. This year we assigned our puzzles points in the range of (23, 199) based on difficulty.

## Layout

Each challenge has a `public/` folder that holds files facing the challenger, and a `private/` folder with solutions and creation files for the challenge. Please ignore any challenge with a `xxx_` prefix.

## Order of Challenges

All challenges should be released sequentially over the _first_ day at GRCon.

## Raw Ideas

* Leah: CLayton's flowgraphs were well done, fun to have troll challenges.
* Leah: Maybe add a slide puzzle.
* Jason: Liked the L+R, L-R stuff, maybe use in something similar. Liked VLAD's NRSC-5 challenges and QR codes.
* Jose: Liked the spread spectrum challenges, being able to recover the code. 
* Cesar: More programming challenges, were none this year.
* Jason: Add more low-value trivia challenges
* Leah: Another image challenge where you need those red-blue glasses to decode.

### kyle thoughts

* Create a challenge where an analog filter has a missing part and you need to find the value to solve the challenge. 
* Add an ML challenge again
* Encode a flag using fruit alphabet instead of NATO alphabet
* Re-use the voice scrambler but convert it to packetized mode
* host a radio server consuming zmq packetized submissions and returning some result
* radio fax? oak ridge has a decoder, does an encoder exist?
* Distribute a 3d-printed antenna or component to solve a challenge
* M17 alternate modes (voice, data, IP traffic)
* embed a spread-spectrum flag underneath an obvious normal flag or two
